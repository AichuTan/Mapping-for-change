      <h2>From Data to Action</h2>
      <h3>Take Action: Building a More Just Downtown</h3>
      <p>
        The patterns of inequality in Downtown San Diego are clear—now it's time
        to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mapping reveals where housing burden, homelessness, and
        environmental injustice concentrate—and who is most impacted. These
        insights should not stay on a dashboard. They are meant to guide
        equity-driven policy, planning, and public investment.
      </p>

      <h4>Partnering for Housing Justice</h4>
      <p>
        The San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC) is leading citywide efforts to
        reduce homelessness through its
        <em>HOUSING FIRST – SAN DIEGO</em> strategy, which has created over
        10,000 housing opportunities since 2014. SDHC also manages shelters,
        rental programs, and workforce initiatives for vulnerable
        groups—including students, youth aging out of foster care, veterans, and
        families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programs like <strong>Guardian Scholars</strong>,
        <strong>Monarch School Project</strong>, and
        <strong>Moving On</strong> provide tailored support to those at risk of
        homelessness. SDHC’s work is central to addressing the Downtown housing
        crisis.
