      <h2>Case Study: Overlapping Urban Injustice in Downtown San Diego</h2>
      <p>
        In the heart of Downtown San Diego, neighborhoods like East Village,
        Cortez Hill, Gaslamp, and the Marina District sit side by side—yet the
        lived experience across these blocks couldn’t be more different. Within
        just a few square miles, some streets are shaded by trees and lined with
        luxury condos, while others are marked by visible encampments, broken
        sidewalks, and a persistent lack of public infrastructure. This case
        study explores these sharp contrasts through spatial data, public
        reports, and field observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore the interactive map below to see where affordability,
        homelessness, and environmental equity intersect across Downtown.

      <h3>East Village: A City Within a City</h3>
      <div class="side-by-side">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Walking through East Village, the signs of crisis are in plain
            sight. Along 17th Street and K Street, clusters of tents occupy
            sidewalks near fenced-off vacant lots. These areas lack benches,
            public restrooms, shade, and basic shelter. Cracked sidewalks and
            closed-off buildings give the impression of a city in retreat from
            its most vulnerable residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conversations with unhoused individuals, many shared feelings of
            being pushed aside, displaced, or ticketed simply for existing in
            public space.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “Multiple tents along 16th Street are blocking sidewalk access. This
            area has become a hotspot for encampments.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            According to spatial data from the ArcGIS Dashboard, East Village
            records over 171 unhoused individuals within a single census tract.
            The Tree Equity Score is just 43—a stark contrast to Little Italy,
            where the score is 88. Median monthly income in East Village is
            around $3,100, while average rent exceeds $1,700. Residents here
            face severe rent burden, environmental heat exposure, and a lack of
            basic urban infrastructure.

      <h3>Cortez Hill: Overlooked and In-Between</h3>
      <div class="side-by-side">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Just uphill from East Village lies Cortez Hill—a neighborhood that,
            at first glance, seems more stable. But along Ash Street and near
            freeway overpasses, encampments quietly persist. Unhoused
            individuals sleep near vacant buildings or under bridges. Public
            amenities are sparse, and tree cover is minimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though the area receives less public attention than East Village, it
            shares many of the same spatial challenges—housing precarity,
            insufficient cooling infrastructure, and urban isolation.

      <h3>Gaslamp & Marina: Clean, Controlled, and Inaccessible</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Only blocks away, the Gaslamp Quarter and Marina District present a
            completely different urban environment. Streets are clean,
            landscaped, and heavily patrolled by private security. Shiny new
            developments and tourist destinations dominate the landscape, while
            public seating and rest areas are few and far between.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the appearance of prosperity, these spaces also tell a
            story—one of exclusion. Gated entryways, luxury retail, and limited
            public infrastructure create a curated space designed for visitors
            and upper-income residents. The absence of encampments here is not
            necessarily the result of social support, but often the outcome of
            displacement, policing, and selective public investment.

      <h3>Little Italy: The Idealized Downtown</h3>
      <div class="side-by-side">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Little Italy provides a visible contrast to East Village. The
            neighborhood boasts high Tree Equity Scores, vibrant public spaces,
            and well-maintained sidewalks. Outdoor cafes, piazzas, and shade
            trees make the area comfortable for residents and pedestrians alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it’s also a place of rising rents and high-income
            exclusivity—few signs of homelessness exist, and housing is often
            out of reach for working-class residents.

      <h3>Spatial Inequality Made Visible</h3>
      <p>
        Ethnographic observations conducted during Spring and Summer 2025 show
        how these inequalities manifest block by block. While East Village
        residents describe heat without relief, housing without hope, and
        feeling invisible to city planners, nearby neighborhoods thrive under
        investment, maintenance, and civic attention.
      </p>
      <p>Another 311 complaint filed in May 2024 illustrates this divide:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Encampment near commercial entrance – multiple people loitering, trash
        building up, fire hazard risk.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yet for those living there, this was one of the only shaded spaces
        available—a temporary refuge in a landscape of exclusion.

      <h3>Conclusion: A Divided Downtown</h3>
      <p>
        Downtown San Diego reveals a city of sharp contrasts, where tree-lined
        streets and luxury housing exist just blocks from visible encampments
        and severe rent burden. These patterns of inequality aren’t random—they
        reflect structural decisions that have excluded vulnerable communities
        from opportunity and infrastructure.
